This is a fullstack DApp built as a study project to learn more about blockchain and smart contract development.  
Made with NodeJS, Hardhat, Solidity, ReactJS, NextJS, Metamask and Alchemy.




# Decentralized Twitter basic action
Decentralized Twitter Dapp is an application where the users can create accounts on twitter and are able to add the tweets, delete the tweets and are able to send the messages from one account to another. As Block chain is decentralized technology and occurs with the help of ethers, we use networks like Groile and Rinkebey with ethers for occurring each and every transaction. In this paper, we used tools like Ethereum IDE and Metamask for deploying the contracts.
